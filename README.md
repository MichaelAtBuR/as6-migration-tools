## Installation

- ✅ **Recommended:** Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/br-automation-community/as6-migration-tools/releases/)  
  Unzip and run `as6-migration-tools.exe`.

- 🐍 **Alternative (Python source):**  
  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Launch `gui_launcher.py` to open the GUI.  
Choose the target script, browse to your AS4 project, and click **Run**.

![Example Analysis Output](docs/gui1.png)

Run any of the scripts from the command line:

```bash
usage: python as4_to_as6_analyzer.py project_path [options]

Scans Automation Studio project for transition from AS4 to AS6

positional arguments:
  project_path   Automation Studio 4.x path containing *.apj file

options:
  -h,        --help      Show this help message and exit
  -v,        --verbose   Outputs verbose information
  --no-file              Skip creating the analysis file in the AS folder

```

Example:

Run the main script to analyze an Automation Studio 4.12.x project:

```bash
python as4_to_as6_analyzer.py "C:\path\to\AutomationStudio4Project"
```

> 💡 **Tip:** If you're using WSL, convert Windows paths like this:  
> `C:\Projects\MyProject` → `/mnt/c/Projects/MyProject`

### Calling a helper script directly

Due to the structure of the project, calling `python helpers/<anyscript>.py` will result in an error.
To prevent this, either use the GUI or change the call to `python -m helpers.<anyscript>` (omit the `.py` extension)

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 (tested)
- Designed for Automation Studio 4.12 projects
- Generates reports to assist in migration to Automation Studio 6.x

---

## Limitations

- This tool does not perform full automatic migration of projects.
- It provides analysis and recommendations to assist developers during migration.
- Helper scripts make best-effort changes based on known patterns, but may not cover all edge cases.
- Manual review and validation is always required after running the tool.
